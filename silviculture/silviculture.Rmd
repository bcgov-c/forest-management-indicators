Managing and conserving the province's Crown forest and range resources
provides environmental, social and economic benefits to all British
Columbians. Silviculture---one of the primary means to enhance the social
and economic benefits from our forest resource---entails the manipulation
of forest and woodland vegetation in stands and on landscapes to meet
the diverse needs and values of landowners and society on a sustainable
basis. This indicator investigates the trends in four measures of
silviculture from 1987 to 2016.


-   **What silvicultural systems are used?** A variety of silvicultural systems are used in B.C. and can be grouped into three general categories: clearcutting, partial cutting, and clearcutting with reserves. Each name reflects the type of forest structure remaining after the initial harvest. The area of Crown
    forest harvested annually averages 209,000 hectares.
    Clearcutting with reserves was the most common silvicultural system
    applied over the last 15 years.
-   **How much is reforested after disturbance?** The area of Crown land
    reforested annually is approximately the same as the area harvested
    two to five years earlier. Additional natural disturbance areas are
    reforested through government funded programs. For example, the
    [Forests for Tomorrow
    program](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=EDA5DA85D4EA43BEBC5868ACA132BF2C)
    has funded 110,000 hectares of rehabilitation planting since 2005.
-   **What incremental silvicultural treatments have been done?**
    Investments in incremental silviculture to improve the growth and
    quality of future crop trees included fertilizing, pruning, spacing
    and using select seed (usually from seed orchards) for planting.
    Since 1987, incremental silvicultural treatments totalled approximately 2.7
    million hectares.
-   **What volume gains will incremental silvicultural treatments
    yield?** Cumulative volume gains 65 years after making investments
    in incremental silviculture since 1987 are estimated at 92 million
    cubic metres (m^3^).

## What Silvicultural Systems Are Used?

```{r silviculture, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 11}
```

-   A Silvicultural system is a planned program of treatments during the whole life of a stand designed to achieve specific stand structural objectives. The three general categories of silvicultural systems used in B.C. are clearcutting, partial cutting, and clearcutting with reserves. Selection of a silvicultural system depends on the ecological traits of the tree species, and on balancing the objectives of the landowner.
-   A variety of silvicultural systems are used in B.C. and can be
    grouped into three general categories: clearcutting, partial
    cutting, and clearcutting with reserves. Each name reflects the type
    of forest structure remaining after the initial harvest.
-   Since 1987, the area of Crown forest harvested annually has ranged
    from 150,000 hectares to 250,000 hectares, with an average of
    approximately 209,000 hectares.
-   From 1987-1996, a clearcutting silvicultural system was applied on
    88% of the area harvested. By 2012, clearcutting with reserves
    accounted for 85% of the area harvested on public forest land. While
    both systems remove the majority of the trees, clearcutting with
    reserves saves some trees within or outside the cutting boundary for
    other purposes such as wildlife habitat, water quality and visual
    landscapes.
    
\newpage

## How Much is Reforested After Disturbance?

```{r dist-refor, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 11}
```

-   Forests disturbed by timber harvests and other natural causes
    reforest naturally over time. Silviculture investments accelerate
    reforestation, increase timber supplies and restore ecological
    services sooner.
-   In 1987, explicit reforestation obligations on public land were
    introduced requiring holders of harvesting rights to reforest the
    areas they harvest. This led to planting a greater proportion of
    harvested areas.
-   In the early 1990’s, increased investments in site preparation,
    research that led to better planting methods, planting,
    rehabilitation planting and brushing ensured prompt restocking and
    the growth of desired trees.
-   Recent catastrophic wildfires and the mountain pine beetle epidemic
    have added large areas with below acceptable stocking. Since 2005,
    the [Forests for Tomorrow
    program](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=EDA5DA85D4EA43BEBC5868ACA132BF2C)
    has funded the reforestation of mountain pine beetle and wildfire
    impacted land not currently under legal reforestation obligations.
-   Forests disturbed by timber harvest can take 7 years or more to
    regenerate, an average of 1.9 years when planted and an average of
    5.5 years when left to reforest naturally. This is referred to as
    regeneration delay and accounts for a large amount of the gap
    between disturbance and reforestation area in the last 7 years.
    
\newpage

## What Incremental Silvicultural Treatments Have Been Done?

```{r treat, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 11}
```


-   Incremental silviculture is an investment in future timber
    production and environmental benefits from forests. Incremental
    silviculture only includes treatments that are not part of basic
    silviculture, where natural unimproved seed sources are used.
    Incremental silviculture can increase timber quantity and quality,
    manage forest health and fire risks, and improve specific habitats,
    water quality and visual landscapes. Incremental silviculture also
    creates employment opportunities for communities.
-   Since 1987, investments in incremental silviculture to improve the
    growth and quality of future crop trees included fertilizing
    (302,000 hectares), pruning (47,000 hectares), spacing (403,000
    hectares) and using select seed---usually from seed orchards---for
    planting (1,856,000 hectares). Over this period, silvicultural
    treatments totalled approximately 2.7 million hectares.
-   The use of select seed increases the rate of tree growth, increasing
    future timber volume, reducing constraints on harvesting adjacent
    areas and reducing the need for costly brushing treatments.
-   Fertilization has seen significant increases since the inception of
    the [Forests for Tomorrow
    program](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=EDA5DA85D4EA43BEBC5868ACA132BF2C)
    in 2005.
-   The [Forests for Tomorrow
    program](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=EDA5DA85D4EA43BEBC5868ACA132BF2C)
    was established to respond to catastrophic wildfires and the
    mountain pine beetle epidemic. Since 2005, the program has funded
    planting on approximately 110,000 hectares of mountain pine beetle
    and wildfire impacted land not currently under legal reforestation
    obligations.
    
    

\newpage

## What Volume Gains Will Incremental Silvicultural Treatments Yield?

```{r gains, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 11}
```

-   Timber volume gains from incremental silviculture are the estimated
    volume gains---based on yield modeling predictions---in 65 years when
    compared to basic silviculture using natural unimproved seed
    sources.
-   Gains from incremental silviculture include increased short- and
    mid-term timber supply through spacing and fertilization,
    accelerated development of mature or old growth forest
    characteristics where needed for wildlife or biodiversity, higher
    wood quality through pruning, more pleasing visual landscapes and
    planting to make up the long-term timber supply.
-   In general, compared with natural regeneration, planting increases
    harvestable volume by about 15% without the use of select seed and
    by about 31% with the use of select seed.
-   Cumulative volume gains 65 years after making investments in
    incremental silviculture since 1987 are estimated at 92 million
    cubic metres (m^3^), based on fertilization (4.2 million m^3^),
    Spacing (6.5 million m^3^), select seed (60.1 million m^3^) and
    reforestation through the [Forests for Tomorrow
    program](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=EDA5DA85D4EA43BEBC5868ACA132BF2C)
    (20.9 million m^3^).

# Glossary

**Basic silviculture** Harvesting methods and silviculture
operations including seed collecting, site preparation, artificial and
natural regeneration, brushing, spacing and stand tending and other
operations as are prescribed to be required for the purpose of
establishing a free growing crop of trees of a commercially valuable
species.

**Below acceptable stocking** Productive forest land that has been
denuded and has failed, partially or completely, to regenerate either
naturally or by planting or seeding to the specified or desired free
growing standards for the site.

**Brushing** A silvicultural activity done by chemical, manual, grazing,
or mechanical means to control competing forest vegetation and reduce
competition for space, light, moisture, and nutrients with crop trees or
seedlings.

**Clearcutting** The process of removing all trees, large and small, in
a stand in one cutting operation.

**Clearcutting with reserves** The removal of the majority of the trees
saving some within or outside the cut boundary for other purposes such
as wildlife habitat, water quality and visual landscapes.

**Fertilizing** The addition of fertilizer to promote tree growth on
sites deficient in one or more soil nutrients. Also used to improve the
vigor of crop trees following juvenile spacing or commercial thinning.

**Forests for Tomorrow** A silviculture program, established by the B.C.
Provincial Government in March 2005 to respond to catastrophic wildfires
and the mountain pine beetle epidemic.

**Incremental Silviculture** Silviculture other than basic silviculture.

**Mid-term timber supply** A term that refers to that portion of the timber inventory that would be available
for harvest within the middle of the normal management cycle.

**Natural regeneration** A change in forest structure and composition
caused by fire, insects, wind, landslides and other natural processes.

**Partial cutting** A variety of silvicultural system in which a stand
may be cut to ensure regeneration. In a partial cutting system, only
some of the trees are felled during the harvesting phase. The selection
method may specify ‘removal’ or ‘leave’ trees. Some examples of
selection criteria are diameter, species, volume, age, height, disease,
or other damage.

**Planting** Establishing a forest by setting out seedlings, transplants
or cuttings in an area.

**Pruning** The manual removal, close to or flush with the stem, of side
branches, live or dead, and of multiple leaders from standing, generally
plantation-grown trees. Pruning is carried out to improve the market
value of the final wood product by producing knot-free wood for the
improvement of the tree or its timber.

**Rehabilitation planting** Where planting occurs on areas disturbed by
a natural event such as fire or insects which has not been salvaged in a
manner that would generate a legal reforestation obligation.

**Select seed** Seed collected from either orchards or natural stand
superior provenances. Select seed exhibits a higher level of improvement
in one or more desired genetic traits (such as growth, form, wood
density, and resistance to insects and disease) than wild seed collected
from an average natural stand.

**Site preparation** Any action, related to reforestation, to create an
environment favourable for survival of suitable trees during the first
growing season. It may alter the ground cover, soil or microsite
conditions, using biological, mechanical, or manual clearing, prescribed
burns, herbicides, or a combination of methods. Both natural
regeneration and planting may be improved through site preparation.

**Spacing** The removal of undesirable trees within a young stand to
control stocking, to maintain or improve growth, to increase wood
quality and value, or to achieve other resource management objectives.
