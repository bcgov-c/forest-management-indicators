# Forest Management Indicators for B.C.

A set of R scripts to create data visualizations for three forest management indicators for B.C. published on [Environmental Reporting BC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=B71460AF7A8049D59F8CBA6EE18E93B8).

- [Trends in Silviculture in B.C. (1987-2015)](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/land/silviculture.html)
- [Trends in Forest Tree Seed Use in B.C. (1987-2016)](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/land/tree-seed-use.html)
- [Trends in Timber Harvest in B.C.](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/land/timber-harvest.html)

### Data
The results data used for the indicators are available from the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?q=stateofforests&sort=score+desc%2C+record_publish_date+desc) under the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).


### Code
There is one R script and one RMarkdown file associated with each indicator.

Most packages used in the analyses can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`, but you will need to install [envreportutils](https://github.com/bcgov/envreportutils), [bcmaps](https://github.com/bcgov/bcmaps), [bcmaps.rdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcmaps.rdata) and [rphylopic](https://github.com/sckott/rphylopic) using remotes:


```r
install.packages("remotes") # If you don't already have it installed

library(devtools)
install_github("bcgov/envreportutils")
install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")
install_github("bcgov/bcmaps.rdata")
install_github("sckott/rphylopic")
```

An installation of LaTeX (e.g. MiKTex, MacTeX or [`tinytex`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tinytex/index.html)) is required to render the .Rmd file to PDF with `knitr`.
