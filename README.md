### Data
The results data used for the indicators are available from the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?q=stateofforests&sort=score+desc%2C+record_publish_date+desc) under the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).


### Code
There is one R script and one RMarkdown file associated with each indicator.

Most packages used in the analysis can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`, but you will need to install [envreportutils](https://github.com/bcgov/envreportutils) and [bcmaps](https://github.com/bcgov/bcmaps) using devtools:


```r
install.packages("devtools") # If you don't already have it installed

library(devtools)
install_github("bcgov/envreportutils")
install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")
```
