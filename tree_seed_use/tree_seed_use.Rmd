Conserving, protecting and managing forest tree genetic resources is the
foundation for economic, social, cultural and ecological goods and
services that flow from British Columbia\'s forests. Tracking forest
tree seed use---from source to planting site---is an important tool for
monitoring and assessment of B.C.'s forest tree genetic resources. This
information supports the continuous improvement of genetic conservation
and resource management plans, strategies and actions, including seed
use best management practices used in reforestation. This indicator
investigates the trends in forest tree seed use in regenerating B.C.\'s
forests from 1987 to 2016.

-   Maintaining genetic diversity, a fundamental component of
    biodiversity, ensures forests and ecosystems are healthy, resilient
    and productive. It also plays an important role in adaptation so
    that forests and ecosystems are able to effectively respond to
    natural disturbance events---such as wildfire, pests and disease
    infestations---as well as the impacts of climate change.
-   The area of B.C\'s crown land reforested through planting has
    remained consistent---with an average over the past ten years of
    approximately 186,000 hectares per year (2007-2016), a slight
    increase over the previous 10 year average of approximately 170,000
    hectares per year (1997-2006).
-   Select seed---seed selected for specific genetic traits such as
    growth, pest resistance, and wood density---includes seed sourced
    from orchards and natural stand superior provenances. Over the past
    two decades, the proportion of crown land planted with select seed
    has steadily increased to 70 percent in 2016.

## Forest Regeneration by Tree Seed Source in B.C. (1987--2016)

\vspace{20pt}

```{r bc_regen, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 11}
```

\vspace{20pt}

-   The chart above displays the change in reforestation
    patterns---planted versus natural regeneration---and the change in
    area of forest planted by tree seed source from 1987 to 2016.
-   After a disturbance by forest fire, forest pest or forest harvest,
    reforestation occurs by natural regeneration, meaning from roots or
    seed, or by planting. Seed used for planting may be from one or more
    genetic sources: orchard, natural stand superior provenance, and
    natural stand non-superior provenance.
-   Both orchard and natural stand superior provenance seed sources have
    a known level of improvement based on extensive forest genetic
    adaptation research trials and tree breeding for the selection of
    desired traits---such as growth, pest resistance and wood density.

## Select Seed Use by Natural Resource District in B.C.

\vspace{20pt}

```{r map_regen, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 11}
```

\vspace{20pt}

-   The chart above displays the percentage of select seed use by
    natural resource district reported in 5-year snapshots from 1991
    to 2016.
-   Select seed use has increased provincially at a steady rate since
    the early nineties: 1991 -- 3%, 1996 -- 18%, 2001 -- 35%, 2006 --
    50%, 2011 -- 63% and 2016 -- 67%.
-   Select seed use at the natural resource district level is more
    variable, in part due to variances in the number and geographic
    range of tree species for which there are orchards. Annual or
    periodic fluctuations in orchard cone crops and seed inventories
    also influence select seed use at local levels.
-   Overall, the increased use of select seed is indicative of the
    substantial effort underway to meet the target set by the Forest
    Genetic Council of British Columbia to, by 2020, increase select
    seed use to 75 percent of the total provincial seed use for
    reforestation.

## Source Data

The Forest Tree Seed Use analysis uses data from:

1.  Reporting Silviculture Updates and Land Status Tracking System
    (RESULTS): <http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/his/results/>; and

2.  Seed Planning and Registry System (SPAR)
    <http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/tree-seed/spar>

Wherever possible, the analysis used public data layers from the B.C.

The layers above that are currently not publicly available in the B.C. Geographic Warehouse
are in the process of being added so that the raw data and source code
can be published to allow interested parties to repeat the analysis.

## Planting

RESULTS openings may have one or more planting treatment report that
contains the area treated, species planted, SPAR seedlot/veglot (lot)
and the number of trees planted. To determine the genetic source by
area, the number of trees planted by lot is prorated to the treatment
area and is reported based on the date planted. The reporting for
planted trees by genetic source is based on the planting date.
Classification for the genetic source is:

-   "A": GENETIC\_CLASS\_CODE = "A"

-   "B+": GENETIC\_CLASS\_CODE = "B" and SUPERIOR\_PRVNC\_IND = "Y"

-   "B": GENETIC\_CLASS\_CODE = "B" and SUPERIOR\_PRVNC\_IND = "N"

-   "B" GENETIC\_CLASS\_CODE = "B" and SUPERIOR\_PRVNCE\_IND is null

-   "B" GENETIC\_CLASS\_CODE is null

Note: Reporting of current trends and patterns in reforestation may be
incomplete due to delays in surveying after a disturbance event
(typically a 1-3 year delay in areas planted and a 3-7 year delay in
areas managed for natural regeneration).

## Natural Regeneration

Natural Regeneration is not reported in RESULTS. Instead, this is
inferred by the existence of planting records. If the sum of the
planting area is &lt;= 10% of the opening, the opening is classified as
natural regenerated and the total Net Area to be Reforested (NAR) of the
opening is used as the area of natural regeneration. The year displayed
for natural regeneration is based on the disturbance end date, if not
available, the disturbance start date is used.

Note: Reporting of current trends and patterns in reforestation may be
incomplete due to delays in surveying after a disturbance event
(typically a 1-3 year delay in areas planted and a 3-7 year delay in
areas managed for natural regeneration).

## Fiscal Year

Fiscal year will be display as follows:

-   Formula used: Fiscal Yr:```IIf(Month([DATE])<4,Year([DATE])-1,Year([DATE]))```

-   Example: 1987-04-01 and 1988-03-31 Fiscal Year = 1988

### QUERY STEPS – Baseline Make Table Queries

All queries are built in Microsoft Access 2007. Make Table queries are
used to create baseline data tables for increased efficiency and data
auditability. Note that all data reported after April 1, 1970 is added
to the baseline but the data are subset to more recent years in the
final queries.

### Make Tables – Planting Area: A, B+, B

  ATU.ACT\_PLANTED\_NO        &gt;0             Isolates only those completed activities with planted trees

###### 1c-Make Unique Opening (outcome: 1c-Unique Opening)

Groups the 1a-Planted Activity table by Opening\_ID to create a unique
list of openings where one or more planting activities have occurred.

###### 1d-Make Opening (outcome: 1d-Opening)

Joins the 1c-Unique Opening table with the Opening\_VW and Opening
source tables to add general overview opening information such as
management unit, opening category and disturbance dates. The Opening
source table will not be needed in this query once the Opening\_VW
ORG\_UNIT attribute is correctly referenced – this fix is expected to be
applied to the BC Data Catalogue layers in the summer of 2016.

###### 3h-Final Natural vs Planted BC

Summarizes the NAR area in 3g-Assess Regen Type-Set by Regen Type. Note
that the Natural Column is what is defined as the total area naturally
regenerated. Planted column is ignored as it is reflected by the
prorated of species trees planted – actuals vs. derived process.

###### 3i-Final Natural vs Planted Org Unit

Takes 3g-Assess Regen Type-Set Threshold that has assigned natural and
planted ratio set and groups the sum of NAR area that is by Regen Type.
Note that the Natural Column is what is defined as the total area
naturally regenerated. This data is summarized by Region and District.
Planted column is ignored as it is reflected by the prorated of species
trees planted – actuals vs. derived process.
